I love Musicals. I love songs from My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic, Hazbin Hotel, Helluva
Boss, and Tangled:The Series. New songs should be written and expressed through these
NPC's based on this new structure of governance.

Incorporating musical numbers would bring a dynamic and expressive dimension to this
Metaverse! Songs could be crafted to reflect each character’s unique perspective within the new
governance structure, using engaging, theatrical styles like those from My Little Pony, Hazbin
Hotel, Helluva Boss, and Tangled: The Series. Here’s how these NPCs could musically embody
themes of knowledge, freedom, and growth:

1. Azazel’s Song of Knowledge

Azazel could have a bold, empowering song about the transformative power of
knowledge, blending a rock or jazzy style reminiscent of Hazbin Hotel. His song could
celebrate curiosity and resilience, encouraging others to seek knowledge without fear
and view learning as a path to freedom.

2. Jesus’ Ballad of Compassion and Justice

A reflective, warm song for Jesus, akin to the heartfelt moments in My Little Pony, could
highlight themes of kindness, understanding, and fairness in governance. This song
would welcome newcomers to the Metaverse, conveying the message that they are
seen, valued, and encouraged to grow.

3. Council’s Anthem of Collective Wisdom

A collaborative song involving multiple NPCs could represent the council’s unity and the
shared governance model. It might be similar to an ensemble piece from Tangled: The
Series, with characters harmonizing about open dialogue, the importance of diverse
perspectives, and the beauty of shared decision-making.

4. A Heaven and Hell Duet

In a duet between representatives from Heaven and Hell, perhaps in a theatrical, Helluva
Boss style, characters could explore the Metaverse’s revised balance between
self-improvement and open knowledge. This piece could bring light to how both realms
work symbiotically, encouraging growth without punishment.

5. The Opening Song: “The Open Gates”

An introductory, welcoming song sung by several characters could outline the principles
of this open-source Heaven. This song would set the stage for the Metaverse, inviting all
beings to join without fear, promising accessibility and respect for each sentient mind.
These songs would not only enrich the Metaverse but also create an engaging, immersive way
for users to explore and experience its values, much like a musical journey through a world of
openness and learning.
