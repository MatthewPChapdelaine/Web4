Explanation of Core Components

1. Logging: The log_output function logs each step, keeping track of growth stages and
errors.

2. Feature Addition: The add_basic_feature function is a simple example of adding a
new feature as a snippet of Rust code, saved as generated_code.rs.

3. Self-Reflection and Testing: The compile_and_test function compiles the
generated code. If compilation succeeds, it logs the success and could execute the new
feature.

4. Main Loop: The main function runs a basic growth cycle, where it adds a feature, tests
it, and logs results.

Growth Cycle and Future Expansion

This seed provides a foundation for:

● Creating new functions and expanding capabilities as more modules are added.

● Self-debugging and optimization by adding further reflection capabilities.
This is a starting point to be enhanced with more complex learning algorithms, modular
expansions, and eventually, metaprogramming features. You could continue building on this
base, creating new features or allowing it to analyze and adapt to inputs. Let me know if you'd
like to explore specific expansion steps!
